# About GovWifi users

GovWifi’s main user groups are:

- end users
- admin users
- decision-makers

You can read more about them in the [user research Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nf27YNimK2iwxwZsnDzzsrtp4v8OTurq).

## End users

End users are people who need to use the internet in government buildings. They may be:

- public sector staff
- contractors
- members of the public who work from public buildings for a period of time - like barristers or jurors
- people attending meetings with public sector organisations

Here's a good sign up experience:

1. The user hears about GovWifi from a poster or other communication from the organisation that manages the building they’re in.
2. They send us a blank email from their public sector email address and receive a GovWifi username and password in reply.
3. They select GovWifi from the list of available wifi networks on their device and enter their username and password.
4. Their device is now connected to the wifi via GovWifi. It will automatically connect in any building they go to in future where GovWifi is available.

It can be harder for people to get a username and password if they do not have a public sector email address. These users can:

- text us and receive credentials in reply (although we do not make the text number publicly available for [various reasons](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1du533O2BgsFNlUmhndDyzGZyUw_BR3AcNWNDvvb03Q4/edit#slide=id.g89f599ebb1_0_0))
- get a public sector ‘sponsor’ to email us with the end user’s email address, and the end user will get a username and password emailed to them

All the information for end users is on our [product pages](https://www.wifi.service.gov.uk/).

## Admin users

Admin users are civil servants who manage GovWifi in their buildings. They’re typically members of the organisation’s IT team.

They install and manage GovWifi, using our [technical documentation](https://docs.wifi.service.gov.uk/) and [GovWifi admin site](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/users/sign_in).

## Decision-makers

The people who make the decision to go ahead with GovWifi are usually senior leaders in public sector organisations.

This usually happens through a procurement process. Often, the organisation is evaluating its wider wifi solution - which may include authentication services like ours.
