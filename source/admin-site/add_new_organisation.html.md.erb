# How to add a new organisation (onboarding)

Organisations can onboard themselves. However, if you need to manually add a new organisation or approve a new public sector email domain, you use the Admin Portal.

The primary method for a support team member is not to 'add' a full organisation, but to 'allow list' their email domain, which then permits their staff to sign up for admin accounts and end-user accounts.

- Log in to the GovWifi Super Admin site with your admin credentials. You will see the main dashboard with a list of all organisations.
Navigate to the 'Allow list' In the left-hand navigation menu, click on 'Allow list'.

- Use the organisation name search on the allow list start page.

If the name appears, check whether the correct email domains are already listed.

- Once the domain is on the 'allow list',the organisation's IT administrator can now go to the standard GovWifi Admin sign-up page and successfully create their account

## If the organisation already has a GovWifi admin account

- Navigate to the 'Allow list' In the left-hand navigation menu, click on 'Allow list'.
  <img src="/images/give_org_access.png">

- Then select 'No' from the options. A confirmation screen will then appear with the information

- A confirmation banner will appear once the organisation has been added to the allow list

_Organisations are added via a rake task that runs at 10pm. This means that they will not appear immediately on the allow list._
