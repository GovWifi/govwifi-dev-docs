# Getting access to the admin portal (organisation admins)

## Who can be an organisation admin

The GovWifi Admin portal is for staff who manage GovWifi at their organisation, such as IT or network support teams.
Admin accounts are individual; they must not be shared between colleagues or used for personal purposes.

## How to get an admin account

- Make sure your work email domain is on the GovWifi allow list. Your Super Admin or the GovWifi team can confirm this.
- Go to the standard GovWifi Admin sign‑up page for your organisation.
- Register using your work email address and follow the sign‑up flow (for example, email link or SSO, depending on configuration).

If your domain is not yet allowed:

- Your organisation’s contact (for example, IT lead) should request that the domain is added to the allow list via the GovWifi team.
- Once added, you can sign up as an admin using your work email address.

## When access should be removed

Your organisation is responsible for:

- Ensuring that staff who change role or leave no longer have admin access.
- Informing the GovWifi team, or using any self‑service controls where available, to remove or disable old admin accounts.
- Keeping the list of admins small and up‑to‑date to reduce security risk.
