# Major incident guidance

## When to treat an issue as a major incident

Treat an issue as a major incident when it affects multiple organisations, a large number of users, or has significant impact on service availability.
Examples include widespread authentication failures, misconfigured IP ranges blocking access, or critical issues with the admin portals.

## Initial checks in the Super Admin portal

When a potential major incident is reported:

- Confirm scope
  - Use connection and troubleshooting views to see whether failures are across many organisations or limited to one.
  - Check whether problems are linked to specific domains, sites or IP addresses.

- Check recent changes
  - Review the activity and change history around the time issues started, focusing on bulk or high‑impact changes.
  - Look for recent organisation, email domain or IP changes that could explain failures.

- Stabilise configuration
  - If you identify a likely cause, consider rolling back or temporarily undoing the change while you investigate.
  - Avoid making multiple unrelated changes, as this can make the process of diagnosis harder.

## Communication and escalation

- Internal coordination
  - Follow your team’s major incident process, assigning an incident manager, technical lead and comms lead.
  - Keep brief time‑stamped notes of decisions and actions.

- External updates
  - Provide clear updates to affected organisations including what is known, what you are doing, and any temporary workarounds.
  - Use agreed support channels and avoid sharing unnecessary personal data from logs or user details.

## After the incident

- Capture what happened, root cause and which portal changes were involved (for example, domain removal, IP edits, organisation changes).
- Identify any process or guidance changes needed (for example, extra checks before bulk updates).
- Update the Super Admin guide and related runbooks so future incidents can be handled more smoothly.
