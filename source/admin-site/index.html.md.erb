# About the admin site

The GovWifi Admin Site is the core platform used by organisation-level administrators. It is the central management interface for the GovWifi service.Each admin account is personal; accounts and credentials must not be shared between colleagues or devices.
## How it works

The Admin Portal allows for:
* Troubleshooting: Viewing real-time user connection logs to diagnose connection issues.
* Infrastructure Management: Managing and configuring the public IP addresses for their physical locations and buildings.

## Who it's for

The Admin site provides different levels of access and functionality, primarily catering to two key user groups:
- GovWifi team/super admins: This group uses the Super Admin Portal for high-level management tasks across all participating organisations.
  This includes manually adding, deleting, or updating public sector organisations and managing their email domain allow lists.
- Organisation Admin Users: Administrators within participating public sector bodies use the GovWifi Admin Portal to manage the GovWifi service for their specific locations.

## How to sign in

- Go to the following URL [GovWifi Admin](https://admin.wifi.service.gov.uk/users/sign_in) provided by the GovWifi team.
- Enter your work email address and follow the sign‑in flow for your organisation (for example, email link or single sign‑on, depending on configuration).
- If you cannot sign in, follow your organisation’s internal process first, then contact the GovWifi support team with details such as your email address, organisation, and approximate time of the failed sign‑in.
