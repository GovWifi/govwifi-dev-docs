# Managing admin accounts

## When to create or change admin accounts

Admin accounts should be created for staff who are responsible for managing GovWifi at their organisation or within the GovWifi team.
Remove or update accounts promptly when staff change role, leave the organisation, or no longer need access for their job.

## Inviting a new organisation admin

- Check whether the organisation and its email domain are already on the allow list.
  Use the allow list search to avoid creating duplicates.
- If the organisation and domain exist, ask the new admin to sign up using their work email address via the standard GovWifi Admin sign‑up page.
- If the domain is not on the allow list, follow the “How to add a new organisation (onboarding)” guidance, then confirm that the user can register.

## Updating or removing an admin

- Use the admin portal’s user management section to find the admin account using their email address.
- Update their details (for example, name or organisation) so they remain aligned with HR records for your organisation.
- When a user no longer needs access, remove or disable their admin account rather than leaving unused accounts active.

Super Admins may need to remove or adjust accounts across multiple organisations as part of wider security or restructuring activity.
