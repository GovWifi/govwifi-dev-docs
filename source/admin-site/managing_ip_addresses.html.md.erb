# How to manage IP addresses

Organisation administrators need to manage the public IP addresses for their physical locations to ensure users can connect to the GovWifi service.

## Viewing current IP addresses

- Navigate to the Locations tab in the main menu. Use the search bar to find the specific building or site you need to update (you can search by postcode, address, or existing IP).
