# Routine maintenance tasks

## Why housekeeping matters
Regular housekeeping helps keep the Admin Portal clean, reduces confusion and prevents issues caused by inaccurate data.
It also supports security by removing unused access paths such as old organisations, domains or admin accounts.

## Suggested housekeeping schedule

The Admins should build a recurring schedule for:

- **Quarterly checks**
  - Review dormant organisations with no recent activity.
  - Audit the **Email domains allow list** to ensure only active domains are authorised.
  - Review admin accounts for staff who have left or changed roles and ensure their access is removed.

- **Annual review**
  - Confirm that guidance in this admin manual still reflects current processes.
  - Sample‑check change history and logs to ensure the portal is being used as expected.

## Best practices for housekeeping

When cleaning up:

- **Verify before deletion:** As there is no "undo" for the delete function, ensure you verify the organisation details (specifically the location and IPs) before clicking the red delete button.
- **Communicate changes:** Notify affected organisations, especially when removing domains or sites that could affect connectivity.
- **Make one change at a time:** Where possible, verify the impact before proceeding with broader clean‑up.

Document any significant housekeeping activities (for example, mass domain removal or bulk site updates) so they can be referenced if issues arise later.
