* **Cryptographic authentication:** When well managed, CBA is more secure than traditional password-based methods.
* **Eliminates the need for shared passwords:** Against our recommendations some organisations share passwords and usernames between devices. Using CBA eliminates the need for this.
* **Automatic Login:** Users can log in automatically without needing to enter passwords, facilitating a smoother user experience.
