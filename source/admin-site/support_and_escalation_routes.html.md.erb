# Support and escalation routes

## When to contact the GovWifi support team

Organisation admins should check the following int the first instance:

- user details
- site configuration
- connection logs

If these do not resolve the issue, or if the problem affects multiple sites or organisations, it should be escalated to the GovWifi support team.
Issues that affect multiple organisations, a large number of users, or overall service availability should be treated as potential major incidents. See ( [Major incident guidance](admin-site/incident_playbook.html.md.erb) )for more detail.

## Information to include in requests

When contacting the GovWifi team or raising a ticket, include:

- Your name, organisation, and admin email address.
- A clear description of the issue, including which portal you are using (Admin or Super Admin).
- Approximate time the problem started and any changes made around that time (for example, IP edits, domain changes, admin account updates).
- Any relevant screenshots or error messages, avoiding unnecessary personal data from logs or user details.

Providing this information upfront helps the GovWifi team investigate more quickly and accurately.
## Handling suspected compromise

If you suspect that an admin account or configuration has been compromised:

- Follow your organisation’s internal security incident process.
- Review recent changes in the admin portal’s activity or change history to identify unexpected edits to organisations, domains, IPs or admin accounts.
- Escalate to the GovWifi team with details of the suspected issue, affected accounts or organisations, and approximate time it was noticed.
