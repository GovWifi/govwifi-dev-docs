# Support and escalation routes

## When to contact the GovWifi support team

Organisation admins should check the following int the first instance:

- user details
- site configuration
- connection logs

If these do not resolve the issue, or if the problem affects multiple sites or organisations, it should be escalated to the GovWifi support team.

## Information to include in an escalation

- A clear description of the problem and who is affected (for example, single user, group, or whole organisation).
- User identifiers, such as username, email address or phone number, where relevant. 
- Approximate timestamps of failed attempts and the sites or IP addresses involved. 

Provide any relevant screenshots or log snippets that illustrate the problem, following the security and data handling guidance. This helps the GovWifi team diagnose issues more efficiently.
