# Deploy applications

Deploying 9 systems out at the same time can be a non-trivial task. This should
help explain how we do it.

## Concourse

Deploying GovWifi is done via Concourse, [hosted by GDS][gds_concourse].

You will need to be part of the GovWifi team, and logged in.

## Core services

For the core services, there is a [central deployment pipeline][concourse_deploy_pipeline].

The code is hosted in the [pipeline repo][concourse_deploy_pipeline_repo]

This covers the:

- Admin site
- Authentication API
- Logging API
- User Signup API
- Frontend RADIUS
- Safe 'Canary' Restarter

The general process is:

1. Run tests.
2. Deploy Staging.
3. Wait for user to allow Production deploy.
4. Deploy Production.

Each service is deployed independently.

To ensure interoperability between the services, we run Cross-Service tests for the Frontend, and APIs.
This ensures that an update to a service will work between the rest of the services.

### Trigger a deployment

1. Merge your development branch to `master`.
2. Concourse will test, build and deploy to the Staging environments.
3. Run the job in the pipeline, titled `Confirm Deploy to <service> Production`.
4. Concourse will deploy to the Production environments.

## Docs and the product page

The [Dev Docs][dev-docs-repo], [Tech Docs][tech-docs-repo], and [Product Page][product-page-repo] 
use a static site generator called [Middleman][middleman].

### Pull Request Previews

Automatic branch previews are deployed to Heroku.

When a PR is raised, a deploy is triggered automatically and the link appears inline on the PR.

### Production

Each repo has it's own pipeline which deploys out to [GovPaaS][govpaas] whenever a change is made to the `master` branch.

#### Trigger a deployment

1. Merge your development branch to `master`.
2. Concourse will build + deploy to GovPaaS.
3. Verify contents is deployed (you may need to add a `GET` parameter to bust the cache).
