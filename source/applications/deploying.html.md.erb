# Deploy applications

Deploying 9 systems out at the same time can be a non-trivial task. This should
help explain how we do it.

## AWS Codepipeline

Deploying GovWifi is achieved via AWS Codepipeline and Codebuild. The code for this is found in the govwifi-deploy module of the [govwifi-terraform repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform).

## Core services

Instructions for deploying the core services can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ORrF2HwrqUu3tPswSlB0Duvbi3YHzvESwOqEY9-w6IQ/edit#heading=h.j6kp1kgy7mfw). You will need to be a member of the GovWifi team to access these instructions.

This covers the:

- Admin site
- Authentication API
- Logging API

When the deployment is complete the ECS service will automatically be restarted. 

Instructions for deploying the Frontend RADIUS service can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bJVGpvwC3uSWNiQ0yJyCbupk-xu4soOo1nsaHe-z550/edit#heading=h.qkkz8te2glxc). You will need to be a member of the GovWifi team to access these instructions.

## Docs and the product page

The [Dev Docs][dev-docs-repo], [Tech Docs][tech-docs-repo], and [Product Page][product-page-repo]
use a static site generator called [Middleman][middleman]. They are hosted on Github Pages.

### Production

Each repo has it's own Github actions workflow which deploys to [Github Pages][https://docs.github.com/en/pages] whenever a PR is pushed to the `master` branch. Example from our [dev-docs](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-dev-docs/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

#### Trigger a deployment

1. Merge your development branch to `master`.
2. Github Actions will build + deploy to Github Pages.
3. Verify contents is deployed (you may need to open an incognito window to clear your cache).
