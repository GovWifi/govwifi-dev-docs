# Deploy applications

Deploying 9 systems out at the same time can be a non-trivial task. This should
help explain how we do it.

## AWS Codepipeline

Deploying GovWifi is achieved via AWS Codepipeline and Codebuild. The code for this is found in the govwifi-deploy module of the [govwifi-terraform repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform).

## Core services

Instructions for deploying the core services can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ORrF2HwrqUu3tPswSlB0Duvbi3YHzvESwOqEY9-w6IQ/edit#heading=h.j6kp1kgy7mfw). You will need to be a member of the GovWifi team to access these instructions.

This covers the:

- Admin site
- Authentication API
- Logging API

When the deployment is complete the ECS service will automatically be restarted. 

Instructions for deploying the Frontend RADIUS service can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bJVGpvwC3uSWNiQ0yJyCbupk-xu4soOo1nsaHe-z550/edit#heading=h.qkkz8te2glxc). You will need to be a member of the GovWifi team to access these instructions.

## Docs and the product page

The [Dev Docs][dev-docs-repo], [Tech Docs][tech-docs-repo], and [Product Page][product-page-repo]
use a static site generator called [Middleman][middleman].

### Pull Request Previews

Automatic branch previews are deployed to Heroku.

When a PR is raised, a deploy is triggered automatically and the link appears inline on the PR.

### Production

Each repo has it's own pipeline which deploys out to [GovPaaS][govpaas] whenever a change is made to the `master` branch.

#### Trigger a deployment

1. Merge your development branch to `master`.
2. Github Actions will build + deploy to GovPaaS.
3. Verify contents is deployed (you may need to add a `GET` parameter to bust the cache).
