# Get started with developing the applications

GovWifi applications are written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) using either [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) web frameworks.


To get started you'll need Ruby installed on your system. We recommend using a Ruby version manager like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) which will allow you to install the correct version of Ruby for GovWifi projects.


## Building a development / test environment

Each GovWifi application Github repository contains a [README](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-admin/blob/master/README.md) detailing how to build a development environment for running tests and making local changes.

Most of the projects use a combination of [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to create the necessary containers and seed data for a local development environment.


## Bug and feature workflow

Please read the [GDS Git styleguide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md) which details how your code commits should be structured.

Once you're happy with your changes locally, submit a pull request, if possible include a reference in the description to the original details (eg. a link to the Trello story), explain what the pull request does, include screenshots if applicable.

Pull requests are linted and tests are run on [Concourse CI](https://cd.gds-reliability.engineering/teams/govwifi/pipelines/admin-pr), the resulting status is shown on the PR.

Once everything is green on CI, you can ask a team member to review your PR.

## Merging and deploying changes

Once approved and merged your PR is automatically built and deployed to our staging environment where you can perform further acceptance testing. After that deploying to production is a manual step in Concourse CI.
