# Learn about the GovWifi applications

Our public-facing websites are:

- A [product page](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-product-page) explaining the benefits of GovWifi
- An [admin site](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-admin) for organiations to make changes to their GovWifi installation
- [Technical documentation](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-tech-docs), explaining GovWifi in more detail
- A [redirection service](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-redirect) to handle "www" requests to these sites

Our services include:

- [FreeRADIUS servers](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-frontend), instances of FreeRADIUS that act as authentication servers (also known as the "frontend" servers)
- An [authentication API](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-authentication-api), which the FreeRADIUS servers call to help authenticate GovWifi requests
- A [logging API](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-logging-api), which the FreeRADIUS servers call to record each GovWifi request
- A [user signup API](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-user-signup-api), which handles incoming sign-up texts and e-mails (with a little help from AWS)

We manage our infrastructure via:

- Terraform, see [govwifi-terraform](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform)
- The [safe restarter](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-safe-restarter), which uses a [CanaryRelease](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html) strategy to increase the stability of the FreeRADIUS servers

Other repositories:

- [Acceptance tests](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-acceptance-tests), which pulls together GovWifi end-to-end, from the various repositories, and runs tests against it.
- [Smoke tests](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-smoke-tests), a collection of rspec with Capybara tests, using Firefox to access the live application. These smoke test the primary service journeys (authentication, sign-up, and admin site user journeys).

Google Analytics:

- Google Analytics is enabled for the [admin site](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-admin), [product page](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-product-page), [Technical documentation](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-tech-docs) using the Google-provided javascript
- It is enabled for the [status page](https://status.wifi.service.gov.uk/) which hosted by Atlassian, using the Atlassian management console.
- Access to the Google Analytics platform is provided on a case-by-case basis as it incurs a cost, and is generally only accessible by the team's business analyst.
- Any member of the team can view data collected by Google Analytics using [Google Datastudio](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/d2311db4-fa9f-407e-ad8b-57bbd9496510/page/K2nbC)
