# Monitoring and instrumentation

Generally, this is done with the AWS tooling. There is information in
ECS about resource usage, and further information in Cloudwatch.

Additionally, requests that pass through the load balancer for the
Admin app are recorded in an S3 bucket.

These logs are queryable through AWS Athena, for example to find
requests that resulted in a 504 response.
