# Communicating with GovWifi users

We use [Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) to send emails and text messages to GovWifi users. If you don't have access to Notify, you can ask someone on the core GovWifi team to give you access.

If you need to send a message to users, you can use the [GovWifi Notify templates](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/services/d1844f74-3895-4a8b-8f75-3eb929763d16/templates).

## Sending messages to Admin users

You can send messages to Admin users by following these steps:

### Obtain a list of admin user emails

1. First download a list of admin user emails from the GovWifi admin portal
2. Make sure you are logged in as a **GovWifi Super Administrator**
3. Select "All Organisations" from the left-hand menu
4. Select "Download all service emails" from the link at the top of the page
