# Two-factor authentication (2FA)

2FA is mandatory for super admin users in the GovWifi admin site. It's currrently optional for admin users.

We use the [`two_factor_authentication`](https://github.com/Houdini/two_factor_authentication) gem to integrate the Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) functionality
with the existing Devise authentication modules.

## 2FA set up

The GovWifi admin site contains a custom set up step which differs from the presumptions of the `two_factor_authentication` gem.

Where 2FA is enforced for a user they will be presented with a set up step as they sign in.

A QR code will be generated for them. They need to scan this with an authenticator app.

The `Users::TwoFactorAuthenticationSetupController` handles the generation of a QR code URI and saving the initial setup against the User model assuming they provide the correct TOTP.

For subsequent logins, when they have successfully entered the correct code the 2FA cookie is set to expire in 24 hours, meaning they will need to enter the relevant TOTP from the authenticator app again. This does not change the user session timeout set by Devise configuration, so authentication sessions will still expire after 1 hour.

## Configuration options for 2FA

The `two_factor_authentication` gem comes with a number of configuration options which can be found in [`config/initializers/devise.rb`](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-admin/blob/master/config/initializers/devise.rb).

```
config.max_login_attempts = 3  # Maximum second factor attempts count.
config.allowed_otp_drift_seconds = 30  # Allowed TOTP time drift between client and server.
config.otp_length = 6  # TOTP code length
config.remember_otp_session_for_seconds = 86400 # Time before browser has to perform 2fA again. Currently 24 hours.
config.otp_secret_encryption_key = ENV['OTP_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY']
config.second_factor_resource_id = 'id' # Field or method name used to set value for 2fA remember cookie
config.delete_cookie_on_logout = false # Delete cookie when user signs out, to force 2fA again on login
```

[`OTP_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is configured via Terraform](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform/commit/11a21b03915a6977e6bc10217513005f05ea7576) and different between staging and production environments, which means that different TOTP codes will be generated between environments.

## Configuring how 2FA is enforced

The `two_factor_authentication` gem will enforce 2FA for all users by default. We control how 2FA is applied via the [`need_two_factor_authentication?` method on the User model](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-admin/blob/master/app/models/user.rb#L54).  
With this method we can include or exclude users from other organisations, it's also possible to configure whether 2FA is necessary in specific environments.

## Resetting 2FA

A super admin user can reset 2FA for any user, by going to that user's organisation page and clicking on the 'Reset 2FA' button next to the user's name under 'Team' section.

Admin users can reset 2FA for any user part of their own organisation, by going to 'Team members' page and clicking on the 'Reset 2FA' link next to the user's name in the members listing.

The button or link to reset 2FA will only be shown against the names of users who have already configured 2FA.
