# Get started on the team

Welcome to the GovWifi team!

## Things all new starters need to do

These are things that everyone who joins the team needs to do, whatever your role is.

### Learn about GovWifi

Here are a few pointers to help you understand the GovWifi service:

- the [About GovWifi](/about-govwifi/#about-govwifi) page
- [product pages](https://www.wifi.service.gov.uk/)
- [tech docs for organisations](https://docs.wifi.service.gov.uk/)
- [past user research](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nf27YNimK2iwxwZsnDzzsrtp4v8OTurq)
- [decision logs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WJgAaziOdiRyalBq7Rp3GFM8twv4FQXD)
- [our support model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z-F7RZ8Ogpr0U7VViRQhr5PSz0_PClGfRmN9zFvdRWo/edit#heading=h.fg506cktsnzs)

There’s also information about the GovWifi team and our [ways of working](/ways-of-working/#ways-of-working).

### Sign up for a GovWifi account

The best way to understand the service is to use it yourself.

You do not need to be in a public sector building to get your sign in details - although you do need to be in one to connect to the internet using GovWifi.

Follow the instructions to [create your GovWifi account](https://www.wifi.service.gov.uk/about-govwifi/connect-to-govwifi/).

### Get a GovWifi admin account

Ask a team member to invite you to create a GovWifi admin account. This lets you see what organisations who offer GovWifi in their buildings can see.

You should also ask to be added to:
- GovWifi admin staging environment
- GovWifi ‘Super admins’ - this is a set of enhanced permissions that lets us oversee organisations using the service

### Check your permissions

If you do not have any of the following permissions, ask the delivery manager or tech lead.

You should have access to:

- the GovWifi Trello team and boards
- the team Google drive
- Zendesk - you should be added to the [2nd/3rd Line -- Zendesk Administration] view

You should be in these Google groups:

- GovWifi Core Team
- GovWifi-support

You should be in these Slack channels:

- `#govwifi-core-team`
- `#govwifi`

Depending on your role, you may also need access to:

- GovWifi’s Notify account
- GovWifi’s Notify staging account
- Google analytics
- the GovWifi-Critical-Alerts Google group
- the GovWifi-Feedback Google group

If you need to use Github, ask the tech lead to add you to the `alphagov` organisation and the `GovWifi` team. The main GovWifi repositories are listed on the [Learn about the GovWifi applications](/applications/#learn-about-the-govwifi-applications) page. There are further instructions on each repository.

The Tech Lead has the Github privileges to add new team members to the `alphagov` organisation and relevant GovWifi Github teams. If the Tech Lead changes, these privileges must be transferred to the new Tech Lead. It's important to email the `gds-github-owners` Google group notifying them that a new Github organisation admin has been added and also add the new Tech Lead to the Google group.

## Things developers need access to

As well as the things that everyone needs to do, there are extra things that new developers need.

You need access to the `GovWifi-DevOps` Google group.

### Infrastructure

- [Request an AWS account](https://gds-request-an-aws-account.cloudapps.digital/). Once you have an account, ask in the #govwifi Slack channel to be added to the GovWifi AWS account.
- [Set up your access to the infrastructure](/infrastructure/#learn-about-infrastructure) - this includes access to databases and ssh.
- [Create a GOV.UK Platform as a Service account](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/get_started.html#get-started). Once you have an account, ask the tech lead to add you to the GovWifi organisation.

### Secrets

You need to [get access to shared secrets](/infrastructure/secrets.html).

### Monitoring and CI/CD tools

You need access to:

- [Concourse](https://govwifi-cd.wifi.service.gov.uk/)
- [Sentry SaaS](https://sentry.io/organizations/government-digital-services/projects/)
- Alerts and logs in [Cloudwatch](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=eu-west-2#)
