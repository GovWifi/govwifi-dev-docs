# Leaving the GovWifi team

All good things must come to an end!

## Things that will need to be done for everyone

These are the things that will need to be done for everyone who leaves the team.

### Remove their access to GovWifi admin

Their access to GovWifi admin on production and staging should be removed. This also includes GovWifi 'Super Admin' permissions.

### Remove permissions

Their access to the following should be removed:

- the GovWifi Trello team and boards
- the team Google Drive
- Zendesk - they should be removed from `[2nd/3rd Lin -- Zendesk Administration]` view

They should also removed from these Google groups:

- GovWifi-Core-Team
- GovWifi-Support

Depending on their role, their access may also need to be removed from:

- GovWifi’s Notify account
- GovWifi’s Notify staging account
- Google Analytics
- the GovWifi-Critical-Alerts Google group
- the GovWifi-Feedback Google group

If they use GitHub, the tech lead will remove them from the relevant GitHub teams (e.g. `govwifi-developers`). If they are also leaving GDS, the tech lead only needs to remove membership from the `alphagov` organisation on GitHub.

## Things that will need to be done for a developer

Remove them from the `GovWifi-DevOps` Google group.

### Infrastructure

- [Remove access to the infrastructure](/infrastructure/#learn-about-infrastructure) - this includes access to databases and ssh.
- [Remove access to GOV.UK PaaS (Platform as a Service)](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/orgs_spaces_users.html#remove-users-from-an-org) - the tech lead will remove them from the GovWifi organisation.

### Secrets

Their access to secrets will need to be removed.

### Monitoring tools

Their access to:

- [Grafana PaaS](https://grafana-paas.cloudapps.digital/?orgId=4)
- [Grafana Self Hosted](https://grafana.wifi.service.gov.uk/)
