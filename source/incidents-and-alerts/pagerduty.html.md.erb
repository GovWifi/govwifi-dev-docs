# Alerts and PagerDuty

PagerDuty is used for out of hours alerting. PagerDuty listens to
notifications from AWS about a subset of the CloudWatch alarms.

## CloudWatch alarms

There are alarms in all three AWS regions.

### US East (`us-east-1`)

#### `wifi-Dublin-Frontend-overall-healthcheck`

This alarm enters the ALARM state if the healthchecks for all three
RADIUS servers in the Dublin region are failing.

This means access points connecting to the Ireland region RADIUS
servers could be unable to authenicate users.

To start investigating this, check the status of the load balancer and
the related target group. If there are targets, but the healthchecks
are failing, then investigate the cause of the healthcheck failures.

#### `wifi-London-Frontend-overall-healthcheck`

This alarm enters the ALARM state if the healthchecks for all three
RADIUS servers in the London region are failing.

This means access points connecting to the London region RADIUS
servers could be unable to authenicate users.

To start investigating this, check the status of the load balancer and
the related target group. If there are targets, but the healthchecks
are failing, then investigate the cause of the healthcheck failures.

### Ireland (`eu-west-1`)

#### `wifi authentication API no healthy hosts`

This alarm enters the ALARM state if there are no healthy hosts behind
the load balancer for the Authentication API.

As this is relied upon by the RADIUS servers in the Ireland region,
this could mean that access points using RADIUS servers in this region
are unable to authenticate users.

To start investigating this, check the status of the load balancer and
the related target group. If there are targets, but the healthchecks
are failing, then investigate the cause of the healthcheck failures.

### London (`eu-west-2`)

#### `wifi authentication API no healthy hosts`

This alarm enters the ALARM state if there are no healthy hosts behind
the load balancer for the Authentication API.

As this is relied upon by the RADIUS servers in the Ireland region,
this could mean that access points using RADIUS servers in this region
are unable to authenticate users.

To start investigating this, check the status of the load balancer and
the related target group. If there are targets, but the healthchecks
are failing, then investigate the cause of the healthcheck failures.

#### `wifi user signup API no healthy hosts`

This alarm enters the ALARM state if there are no healthy hosts behind
the load balancer for the User Signup API.

This service handles users signing up for GovWifi via text messages
and emails. If there are no healthy hosts, it's likely that this
functionality isn't working.

To start investigating this, check the status of the load balancer and
the related target group. If there are targets, but the healthchecks
are failing, then investigate the cause of the healthcheck failures.

#### `wifi admin no healthy hosts`

This alarm enters the ALARM state if there are no healthy hosts behind
the load balancer for the Admin app.

The Admin application allows organisations to manage their GovWifi
installation. If there are no healthy hosts, it's likely that the
application is unusable.

To start investigating this, check the status of the load balancer and
the related target group. If there are targets, but the healthchecks
are failing, then investigate the cause of the healthcheck failures.
