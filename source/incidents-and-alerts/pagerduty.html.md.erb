# PagerDuty

PagerDuty is used for out of hours alerting. PagerDuty listens to sns notifications from AWS about a subset of the CloudWatch alarms.

## Configuring PagerDuty

 Configuration of the on-call schedule is done in the PagerDuty web interface. For details on how to setup PagerDuty with AWS, or adjust any of the settings, please see
 [PagerDuty Configuration Doc in the GovWifi Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KIOyNAC_15unYRH7aEECKTkcNID6o0Pa___M3VmtBpI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.vna0jm7rghiz).

## CloudWatch alarms

There are alarms in all three AWS regions.

### Ireland (`eu-west-1`)

#### 'wifi frontend no healthy hosts'

This alarm enters the ALARM state if there are no healthy hosts for all three RADIUS servers in the Dublin region.

This means access points connecting to the Ireland region RADIUS servers could be unable to authenticate users.

To start investigating this, check the status of the load balancer and the related target group. If there are targets, but the healthchecks are failing, then investigate the cause of the healthcheck failures, cloudwatch logs, etc.

#### `wifi authentication API no healthy hosts`

This alarm enters the ALARM state if there are no healthy hosts behind the load balancer for the Authentication API.

As this is relied upon by the RADIUS servers in the Ireland region, this could mean that access points using RADIUS servers in this region are unable to authenticate users.

To start investigating this, check the status of the load balancer and the related target group. If there are targets, but the healthchecks are failing, then investigate the cause of the healthcheck failures.

### London (`eu-west-2`)

#### 'wifi frontend no healthy hosts'

This alarm enters the ALARM state if there are no healthy hosts for all three RADIUS servers in the London region.

This means access points connecting to the London region RADIUS servers could be unable to authenticate users.

To start investigating this, check the status of the load balancer and the related target group. If there are targets, but the healthchecks are failing, then investigate the cause of the healthcheck failures.


#### `wifi authentication API no healthy hosts`

This alarm enters the ALARM state if there are no healthy hosts behind
the load balancer for the Authentication API.

As this is relied upon by the RADIUS servers in the Ireland region,
this could mean that access points using RADIUS servers in this region
are unable to authenticate users.

To start investigating this, check the status of the load balancer and
the related target group. If there are targets, but the healthchecks
are failing, then investigate the cause of the healthcheck failures.

#### `wifi user signup API no healthy hosts`

This alarm enters the ALARM state if there are no healthy hosts behind
the load balancer for the User Signup API.

This service handles users signing up for GovWifi via text messages
and emails. If there are no healthy hosts, it's likely that this
functionality isn't working.

To start investigating this, check the status of the load balancer and
the related target group. If there are targets, but the healthchecks
are failing, then investigate the cause of the healthcheck failures.

#### `wifi admin no healthy hosts`

This alarm enters the ALARM state if there are no healthy hosts behind
the load balancer for the Admin app.

The Admin application allows organisations to manage their GovWifi
installation. If there are no healthy hosts, it's likely that the
application is unusable.

To start investigating this, check the status of the load balancer and
the related target group. If there are targets, but the healthchecks
are failing, then investigate the cause of the healthcheck failures.
