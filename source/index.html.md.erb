# GovWifi Team Manual

This is the Team Manual for GovWifi. It should be a clear, accurate source of information about working on the service.

In particular, it aims to be:

- an introduction to the service for new starters
- a practical guide to common tasks that the team does

These pages are public. We work in the open, so feel free to add and update them with anything you think would be useful. However, do not add:

- anyone’s personal details without their consent
- passwords
- Secrets
- IP addresses
- any sensitive information - for example, about strategy or technology - that would be a risk to GovWifi or GDS if it was public

If you’re not sure, check with the product manager, delivery manager or tech lead.

## Keeping the manual up to date

Anyone on the team can update the manual. It's a shared resource and does not need a gatekeeper. 

To update it, you need a Github account and to be part of the GovWifi Github team. You can then make changes from the [repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-dev-docs). There are [instructions on how to do this](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rYhl2LdnVAoL-_-6g72U7mJwHTfO0BujHts7pnFkr7s/edit#slide=id.gbaccf4e5c5_0_11) if you're new to Github.

To make sure we do not forget about updating the manual, each page has a review date. When a page passes that review date, there will be a prompt to review it on the #govwifi Slack channel.
