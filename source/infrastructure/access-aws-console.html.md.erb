# Access the AWS console

Access is via [gds-users](https://gds-users.signin.aws.amazon.com/console), and then assuming your role from the GovWifi account. You must be on the VPN to access the console.

Staging and Production are hosted within the same AWS account.

The GovWifi Account ID is `788375279931` and your role is in the form `firstname.lastname-admin` or `firstname.lastname-readonly`.
