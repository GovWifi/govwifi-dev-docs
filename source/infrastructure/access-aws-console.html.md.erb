# Access the AWS console

First ensure that your access has been set up by the team. [If you need to add someone to the GovWifi AWS account follow this guide](https://gds-way.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/manuals/working-with-aws-accounts.html#use-the-command-line).

Access is via [gds-users](https://gds-users.signin.aws.amazon.com/console), and then assuming your role from the GovWifi account. You must be on the VPN to access the console.

Staging and Production are hosted in different AWS accounts.

Ask the reliability engineers for the GovWifi account IDs. AWS roles are in the form `firstname.lastname-admin` or `firstname.lastname-readonly`.

#### Using cod-cli

This utility is being replaced with cod-cli (https://github.com/GovWifi/cod-cli).

The remainder of this section is retained until everyone has migrated to cod-cli

You can also use the [`cod-cli`](https://github.com/govwifi/cod-cli) to access the GovWifi AWS console.

Review the [configuration instructions](https://github.com/govwifi/cod-cli#configuration) on the `gds-cli` README to set it up. Note: gds-cli may be aliased to gds. [Indepth guidance on setting up the gds-cli can be found on GDS's help pages](https://gds-way.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/manuals/working-with-aws-accounts.html#installing-gds-cli).

Once the `gds-cli` is set up, run the following command from anywhere in your terminal to login as `read-only` to Production:

```bash
$ gds aws govwifi-readonly -l
```

If you have admin privileges in the Production AWS account, you can run a similar command to login as `admin`:

```bash
$ gds aws govwifi -l
```

You can login as `read-only` to Staging by running the following command:

```
$ gds aws govwifi-staging-readonly -l
```

You can login as `admin` to Staging by running the following command:

```
$ gds aws govwifi-staging -l
```

You can login as `admin` to Development by running the following command:

```
$ gds aws govwifi-development -l
```

You can login as `admin` to Tools by running the following command:

```
$ gds aws govwifi-tools -l
```


You can login as `admin` to Recovery by running the following command:

```
$ gds aws govwifi-recovery -l
```
## Extend Session time
By default the session time is 1 hour, then you get logged out, this can br frustrating, especially if you have several tabs open, thankfully there is a way to fix this.
### From CLI
`cod-cli aws govwifi-development -l --art 8h`
