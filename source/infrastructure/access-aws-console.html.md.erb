# Access the AWS console

Access is via [gds-users](https://gds-users.signin.aws.amazon.com/console), and then assuming your role from the GovWifi account.

Staging and Production are hosted within the same AWS account.

The GovWifi Account ID is `788375279931` and your role is in the form `firstname.lastname-admin` or `firstname.lastname-readonly`.
