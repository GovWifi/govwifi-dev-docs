# Access the AWS console

Access is via [gds-users](https://gds-users.signin.aws.amazon.com/console), and then assuming your role from the GovWifi account. You must be on the VPN to access the console.

Staging and Production are hosted within the same AWS account.

The GovWifi Account ID is `788375279931` and your role is in the form `firstname.lastname-admin` or `firstname.lastname-readonly`.


### Use the `gds-cli`

You can also use the [`gds-cli`](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-cli) to access the GovWifi AWS console.

Review the [configuration instructions](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-cli#configuration) on the `gds-cli` README to set it up.

Once the `gds-cli` is set up, run the following command from anywhere in your terminal to login as `read-only`:

```bash
$ gds aws govwifi-readonly -l
```

If you have admin privileges in AWS, you can run a similar command to login as `admin`:

```bash
$ gds aws govwifi -l
```
