# Access bastion servers

## Secrets

[Extract the SSH Key secrets](/infrastructure/secrets/#get-started-using-secrets) for the bastion server:

- staging secret name: `keys/govwifi-staging-bastion-key`
- production secret name: `keys/govwifi-bastion-key`

Find out the Elastic IPs for the bastion servers. You can do this by going into the AWS console,
and find the instances with the Bastion name in.

Remember that there are 2 regions, so there may be more than 2 bastions.

## SSH Config

It is recommended to set up an ssh config for ease of use. Instructions how to
set up your SSH config is in the Password Store of Govwifi where you can run:

```sh
PASSWORD_STORE_DIR=<password_store_dir> pass show ssh/instructions.txt
```

where `<password_store_dir>` is the path of the `passwords` directory of the
[govwifi-build](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-build) repository on your
local machine.

You should now be able to connect to each of the hosts using ssh and the hostnames mentioned in `instructions.txt`.

Example:

```sh
ssh example.hostname
```
