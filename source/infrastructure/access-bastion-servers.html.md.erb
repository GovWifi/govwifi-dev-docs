# Access bastion servers
As we move from SSH to SSM, this server is now used to access the database, access to the other ec2's is made directly via SSM.

## Secrets

[Extract the SSH Key secrets](https://dev-docs.wifi.service.gov.uk/infrastructure/secrets.html#get-started-using-secrets) for the bastion server:

- Dev (alpaca) secret name: `keys/alpaca-bastion-20230120`
- staging secret name: `keys/govwifi-staging-bastion-key-20200717`
- production secret name: `keys/govwifi-bastion-key`

## SSH/SSM Config

We have transitioned to SSM, there should be no differences when running commands, the only difference is in the config, for example you'll now need to know the instance id of the host rather than the IP address.

We recommended setting up a SSH config for ease of use. Instructions how to set up your SSH config exist in the Password Store of GovWifi where you can run:

```sh
PASSWORD_STORE_DIR=<password_store_dir> pass show ssh/instructions.txt
```

where `<password_store_dir>` is the path of the `passwords` directory of the [govwifi-build](https://github.com/GovWifi/govwifi-build) repository on your local machine.

You should now be able to connect to each of the hosts using `ssh` and the hostnames mentioned in `instructions.txt`.

Example:

```sh
ssh example.hostname
```
