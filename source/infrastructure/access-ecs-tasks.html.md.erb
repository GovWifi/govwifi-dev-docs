# Access ECS tasks with ECS Exec

[ECS Exec][ecs exec] is a way of using the AWS CLI to launch programs
within ECS tasks, including interactive programs like shells.

[ecs exec]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-exec.html

## Prerequisites

You'll need both the AWS CLI, plus the [Session Manager plugin][session manager plugin].

The Session Manager plugin can be downloaded from AWS or installed
using package managers like Homebrew.

Note: gds-cli may or may not be aliased to gds on your system.

[session manager plugin]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html

## Examples

This is a general template to launch an interactive shell within a
specific task and container:


```sh
gds aws ACCOUNT -- aws ecs execute-command --region REGION --cluster CLUSTER --task TASK --container CONTAINER --interactive --command "/bin/sh"
```

For example, getting a shell within a frontend task in staging would look like:

```sh
gds aws govwifi-staging -- aws ecs execute-command --region=eu-west-2 --cluster frontend-fargate --task 180f3f7138704925bcfcecda1996f5b4 --container frontend-radius --interactive --command "/bin/sh"
```

The specific cluster names, task IDs and container names can be found
through the AWS website.
