# Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

The GovWifi team does not run production workloads within the GCP but some service components rely on the integration with GCP as an interface to Google resources.

GCP is used in the context of:

- Single Sign-On authentication to Grafana servers
- access to Gmail functionality on the application level, used by smoke tests
- access to Google Drive resources, used to store backups of Organisation Emails

For details of GCP projects attributed to the GovWifi service (at various development stages), current owners and how to access and find configured resources please refer to the [GCP Projects review](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B0uo92ZXqCEJqZzgdQY1ncq9nohKDTS-7SJwueMgieM/) document.
