# Add new AWS users

You can add new AWS users to the GovWifi AWS accounts by following the instructions below:

1. Ensure the person has been added to the central AWS user management account gds-users, if they haven't [they can request to be added via this form](https://request-an-aws-account.gds-reliability.engineering/).

1. Verify with the GovWifi developers whether to grant `admin` or `read-only` access. Only team members with security clearance can be allowed `admin` access. Until security clearance is passed `read-only` access is allowed.

1. Add the user with the appropriate privileges to the [Terraform code that describes GovWifi's account](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-ops-private/blob/master/reliability-engineering/terraform/deployments/re-govwifi/account/site.tf). You need to get the pull request approved and merged by Reliability Engineering.

1. Deploy the Terraform changes by:

     a. Navigate to the [GovWifi account directory Terraform](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-ops-private/tree/master/reliability-engineering/terraform):

     ```sh
     cd terraform/deployments/re-govwifi/account/
     ```

     b. Using the [gds-cli](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-cli), note: gds-cli may be aliased to 'gds', initialise Terraform if you have not done so previously:

     ```sh
     gds aws govwifi -- terraform init
     ```

     c. Run `plan` on the Terraform project to ensure the changes are what you intend to deploy:

     ```sh
     gds aws govwifi -- terraform plan
     ```

     d. Run `apply` on the Terraform changes if you are happy to proceed:

     ```sh
     gds aws govwifi -- terraform apply
     ```
