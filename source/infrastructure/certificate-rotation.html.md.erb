# GovWifi certificates

We rotate the GovWifi certificate every year.

The actual rotation is handled by the SREs.

When the rotation is done, we need to update the following things.

## Update the product pages

The [product pages](https://www.wifi.service.gov.uk/) mention the certificate GovWifi uses in text and screenshots.

You can find and update this content in the [product pages repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-product-page) on Github.

## Update the email template

When new end users sign up, they receive an email. The email includes certificate details like the issuer and thumbprint.

You can find and update the template in [Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
