# GovWifi Certificates

GovWifi certificates are rotated every couple of years.

The actual rotation is handled by the SREs. In addition, the following will also need to be updated once this is done:

## Product pages

There are a number of pages here which include information about the certificate GovWifi uses, including text and screenshots images. These would need to be updated in order to remain relevant and correct.

## Email template

The welcome email includes certificate details, including issuer and thumbprint. These would need to be updated.
