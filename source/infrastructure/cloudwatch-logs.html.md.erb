# View CloudWatch logs


## Access to CloudWatch

You must be on-boarded to GovWifi's AWS account in order to access CloudWatch logs.

Please speak to the GovWifi reliability engineers or the delivery manager about this process.

## Logging in to CloudWatch

Log in to GovWifi AWS via the [`gds-cli`](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-cli) or the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?nc2=h_ct&src=header-signin).

You must be on the VPN to log in.

### CLI login

Ensure `gds-cli` is configured on your laptop and your AWS credentials are set up.

Then run:

```sh
$ gds aws govwifi -l
```

Using the AWS service search bar, navigate to the CloudWatch service section.

### Console login

1. Log in to the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?nc2=h_ct&src=header-signin)
2. Navigate to [CloudWatch](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=eu-west-2#)
3. Choose [“Log groups”](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=eu-west-2#logsV2:log-groups) from the “Logs” sidebar. You can also use [“Insights”](https://eu-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=eu-west-2#logsV2:logs-insights) which is a log aggregation tool in CloudWatch.

You can read more about the CloudWatch Insights query DSL [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CWL_QuerySyntax.html).

## CloudWatch logs

CloudWatch contains unstructured system and application logs for GovWifi's APIs and infrastructure components.

Since the service is region-based, make sure you're reviewing logs for the correct region by selecting the relevant region from the AWS service bar.

### Application log types

The application log group naming is inconsistent. It roughly uses the following convention:

```
<environment>-<service>-log-group
```

|   Service/API  | Environment |                  Log group                 |
|----------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| FreeRADIUS     | Staging     | `frontend`                                   |
|                | Production  | `frontend`                                   |
| Admin          | Staging     | `staging-admin-log-group`                    |
|                | Production  | `wifi-admin-log-group`                       |
| Authentication | Staging     | `staging-authentication-api-docker-log-group` |
|                | Production  | `wifi-authentication-api-docker-logs`         |
| User Sign-up   | Staging     | `staging-user-signup-api-docker-log-group`   |
|                | Production  | `wifi-user-signup-api-docker-log-group`      |
| Logging        | Staging     | `staging-logging-api-docker-log-group`       |
|                | Production  | `wifi-logging-api-docker-log-group`          |
| Grafana        | Staging     | `staging-grafana-log-group`                  |
|                | Production  | `wifi-grafana-log-group`                     |
| Prometheus     | Staging     | `staging-prometheus-log-group`               |
|                | Production  | `wifi-prometheus-log-group`                  |

**Note**:

- "Production" is referred to as "wifi" throughout the infrastructure. So `wifi-admin-log-group` refers to the Production Admin API log group.
- We have deprecated the <staging | wifi>-frontend-docker-log-group groups since moving the Frontend ECS clusters from EC2 instances to ECS Fargate.

### System log types

System logs for EC2 instances follow a separate pattern:

```
<environment>-<instance name>/var/log/<log-type.log>
```

|  EC2 instance  | Environment |                  Log group                 |
|----------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Bastion        | Staging     | `staging-bastion/var/log/*`                |
|                | Production  | `wifi-bastion/var/log/*`                   |
| Frontend ECS cluster | Staging | `staging/var/log/*`                      |
|                | Production  | `wifi/var/log/*`                           |

**Note**: The Frontend ECS clusters run on Fargate and follow this naming pattern: `/aws/ecs/containerinsights/frontend-fargate/*`
