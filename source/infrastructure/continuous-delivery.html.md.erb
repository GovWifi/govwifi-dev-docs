# Continuous Delivery

GovWifi uses [AWS CodeBuild](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) for its continuous delivery.

## GovWifi CI/CD history

Previously, the team was part of a multi-tenanted Concourse, known as Big Concourse, maintained by the GDS Automate team.
Big Concourse was decommissioned on 15 December, 2021.

The team migrated to a single-tenanted Concourse, known as GovWifi Concourse, maintained by the GovWifi team and based
on the [`big-little-concourse`](https://github.com/alphagov/big-little-concourse-deployment) repo developed by the
Platform as a Service (PaaS) team.

Over the course of 2022 the team migrated to AWS CodeBuild to align with Cabinet Office Digital tooling.

## GovWifi CodeBuild

GovWifi CodeBuild is configured in the following repository:

- [`govwifi-terraform`](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform) under [`govwifi-deploy`](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform/tree/master/govwifi-deploy)

Updates to the CodeBuild infrastructure configuration happen in Terraform code. Please follow the `govwifi-terraform` [README guidelines](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform#govwifi-terraform) for contributing, updating, and deploying code changes.

Pipeline configuration exists in `buildspec.yml` files in individual repos ([here is an example](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-admin/blob/master/buildspec.yml) for `govwifi-admin`)

## Deploy using CodeBuild

The deployment documentation for Frontend FreeRADIUS code, GovWifi APIs, and Admin app requires access to Google Drive.

Use the following instructions for deployment:

- [Deploying Frontend](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bJVGpvwC3uSWNiQ0yJyCbupk-xu4soOo1nsaHe-z550/edit#heading=h.qkkz8te2glxc)
- [Deploying the APIs and Admin app](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ORrF2HwrqUu3tPswSlB0Duvbi3YHzvESwOqEY9-w6IQ/edit#heading=h.j6kp1kgy7mfw)

### Deployment access

A team member must be added as an admin to the `govwifi-tools` user account in the `tech-ops-private` repo in order to access and deploy pipelines in the AWS console. If you don't have access ask in the #govwif Slack channel to be onboarded.

Once this onboarding is complete then team members can log in to the AWS console as the `govwifi-tools` user:

```bash
$ gds aws govwifi-tools -l
```

### Monitor deployments

GovWifi CodeBuild uses built-in AWS monitoring for general observability of its infrastructure.

You must be on the VPN and have access to the AWS console to access the monitoring.

Log in as the `govwifi-tools` user and navigate to AWS CloudWatch to view metrics about the deploy process and pipelines.
