# Database backups

GovWifi databases are automatically backed up, a process covered by the [govwifi-database-backup repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-database-backup).

This repo contains scripts used to perform the automated data export of all GovWifi MySQL databases.

GovWifi databases are exported using `mysqldump`. The contents of the SQL dump are compressed and stored in Amazon S3.

Backups are scheduled to run nightly and target replica instances. This is in addition to automated RDS snapshots of primary servers.

The backup script runs as a scheduled container task using Amazon ECS which is configured in [govwifi-terraform](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform/tree/master/govwifi-api) under `database-backup-task.tf`.
