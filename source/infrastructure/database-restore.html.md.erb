# Restoring Databases

The nightly database backups for each environment are stored an S3 bucket for each Govwifi environment called govwifi-<subdomain-name/environment-name>-london-mysql-backup-data. IT also keep an additional copy of these backups. In the event that we loose access to our AWS accounts, we can [request a copy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h07adu7Ym6yN4kULbDskHQO91LhHpKMFSi4wxyZi1zs/edit#heading=h.v8cb2maaksg4) directly from IT. Databases can be restored from the nightly backups by following the instructions below:

Locate the gpg passphrase you need in the [govwifi-build](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-build/) repo (for example the passphrase for staging is located [here](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-build/blob/master/passwords/keys/govwifi-database-staging-s3-encryption-key.gpg)). Retrieve the secret using the following command
```
PASSWORD_STORE_DIR=~/path_to_govwifi-build-repo-on-your-machine/passwords pass edit keys/<s3_encryption_file_name>
```

Download the file database backup file that you need and run:

To decrypt with gpg
```
gpg --output govwifi-backup-databasename.sql.gz --decrypt govwifi-backup-databasenam.sql.gz.gpg
```

Then upload to the file to the bastion server in the eu-west-2 region, for example:

```
mkdir /tmp/db_restore

scp govwifi-backup-databasenam.sql.gz.gpg bastion.staging.govwifi:/tmp/db_restore
```

Unzip the file:
```
gzip -d govwifi-backup-admin-databasename.sql.gz
```

Import into mysql (the database credentials are located in AWS secret manager)
```
mysql -u <username> -h <hostname> -D <databasename> -p < govwifi-backup-databasename.sql
```
