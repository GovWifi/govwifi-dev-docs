# Restoring Databases

Note: gds-cli maybe installed and accessible via either gds-cli or gds depending on your installation. gds is also an alias belonging to github cli tools.

The nightly database backups for each environment are stored an S3 bucket for each Govwifi environment called govwifi-<subdomain-name/environment-name>-london-mysql-backup-data. IT also keep an additional copy of these backups. In the event that we loose access to our AWS accounts, we can [request a copy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h07adu7Ym6yN4kULbDskHQO91LhHpKMFSi4wxyZi1zs/edit#heading=h.v8cb2maaksg4) directly from IT. Databases can be restored from the nightly backups by following the instructions below:

Locate the gpg passphrase you need in the [govwifi-build](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-build/) repo (for example the passphrase for staging is located [here](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-build/blob/master/passwords/keys/govwifi-database-staging-s3-encryption-key.gpg)). Retrieve the secret using the following command
```
PASSWORD_STORE_DIR=~/path_to_govwifi-build-repo-on-your-machine/passwords pass edit keys/<s3_encryption_file_name>
```

Locate the correct database file, e.g. staging backup files:
```
gds-cli aws govwifi-staging -- aws s3 ls govwifi-staging-london-mysql-backup-data
```

Download the database backup file that you need, e.g. staging admin DB:
```
gds-cli aws govwifi-staging -- aws s3 cp s3://govwifi-staging-london-mysql-backup-data/govwifi-backup-admin-2023-01-25-00-30.sql.gz.gpg .
```

Decrypt with gpg:
```
gpg --output govwifi-backup-databasename.sql.gz --decrypt govwifi-backup-databasenam.sql.gz.gpg
```

Then upload to the file to the staging bastion server in the eu-west-2 region, e.g.:

```
scp govwifi-databasename-datetime.sql.gz bastion.staging.govwifi:/tmp
```

Login to the bastion server and unzip the file:
```
cd /tmp
gzip -d govwifi-backup-admin-databasename.sql.gz
```

Import into mysql (the database credentials are located in AWS secrets manager)
```
mysql -u <username> -h <hostname> -D <databasename> -p < govwifi-backup-databasename.sql
```
