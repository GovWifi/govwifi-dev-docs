# Deploy Terraform

Terraform is deployed on the commandline using `make` commands configured in the `govwifi-terraform` [Makefile](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform/blob/master/Makefile).

Please refer to the `govwifi-terraform` [README](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform/blob/master/README.md) for detailed instructions on running Terraform.

The instructions here provide a high level overview of deploying changes in our Terraform

**Environments**

| Environment |  Region |         Name        |  AWS Account        |
|:-----------:|:-------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|
| Staging     | London  | staging             | 99**********        |
|             | Ireland | (also staging)      | 99**********        |
| Production  | London  | wifi-london         | 78**********        |
|             | Ireland | wifi                | 78**********        |

## Prerequisites

These must be complete in order to deploy Terraform changes:

* On-boarded to GovWifi's AWS account
* AWS credentials set up on laptop

It's recommended but not required to use the [`gds-cli`](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-cli).

## Deploy to Staging

Deployments in `govwifi-terraform` pull in changes using modules
configured in the Terraform files located in `govwifi/staging`
directory:

* [`govwifi/staging`](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform/tree/master/govwifi/staging)

To deploy Terraform changes to the staging environment, navigate to the project root:

```
$ cd govwifi-terraform
```

Ensure the branch is up-to-date by pulling the latest changes from git (`git pull`).

Run the relevant `make` command:

```
$ make staging plan
```

If you are using the `gds-cli`, use to the staging GovWifi account:

```
$ gds aws govwifi-staging -- make staging plan
```

## Deploy to production

The deploy process is very similar to staging.

The production modules in `govwifi-terraform` are:

* [`govwifi/wifi-london`](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform/tree/master/govwifi/wifi-london)
* [`govwifi/wifi`](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-terraform/tree/master/govwifi/wifi)

**Note**: `wifi` refers to components in eu-west-1 (Ireland).

Follow the same instructions for staging (i.e., navigate to the root project directory and ensure the branch is up-to-date).Ireland

The `make` command for production is:

```
$ make wifi-london plan
```

If using the `gds-cli` it's:

```
$ gds aws govwifi -- make wifi-london plan
```
