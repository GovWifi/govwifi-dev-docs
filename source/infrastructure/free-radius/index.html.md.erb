# GovWifi's FreeRADIUS Implementation

GovWifi operates six FreeRADIUS servers, hosted on AWS.


The FreeRADIUS servers operated by the GovWifi team control network access with
[AAA authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(computer_security)).

## Authentication

Authentication requests are received on the default port, 1812.

User details are checked against the GovWifi users database via the FreeRADIUS REST module, which communicates with the [ GovWifi Authentication API](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-authentication-api).

## Authorisation

GovWifi authenticates users seeking to access WiFi networks operated by host organisations which have adopted the GovWifi service. It is not used to authorise users' access to particular network services (though FreeRADIUS can be used for this).

>The processing sections concerned with authorisation (distinct from the 'authorize' processing section, see above) are configured to carry out no operations in the GovWifi FreeRADIUS configuration.


## Accounting

Traffic on port 1813 isn't routed through to FreeRADIUS.

## Unlang

FreeRADIUS is configured using a language called [Unlang](https://freeradius.org/radiusd/man/unlang.html).

We favor keeping all complex functionality in the backend APIs, instead of in Unlang.

This way it is easier to test and change in the future.

## FreeRADIUS Server

This is the software installed on our RADIUS servers.

It is open source and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server).

## The frontend health check

Within the frontend task, a Ruby process listens on port `3000`. When
it receives a request for `"/"`, it runs
[`eapol_test`][frontend-eapol]), which replicates the requests that
come from deployments of GovWifi. This includes connecting to the
Authentication and Logging APIs.
