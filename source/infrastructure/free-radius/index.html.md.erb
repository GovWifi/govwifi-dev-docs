# GovWifi's FreeRADIUS Implementation

GovWifi operates six FreeRADIUS servers, hosted on AWS.

## Authentication

Authentication requests are received on the default port, 1812.

User details are checked against the GovWifi users database via the FreeRADIUS REST module, which communicates with the [ GovWifi Authentication API](https://github.com/alphagov/govwifi-authentication-api).

## Authorisation

GovWifi authenticates users seeking to access WiFi networks operated by host organisations which have adopted the GovWifi service. It is not used to authorise users' access to particular network services (though FreeRADIUS can be used for this). 

>The processing sections concerned with authorisation (distinct from the 'authorize' processing section, see above) are configured to carry out no operations in the GovWifi FreeRADIUS configuration.

## Accounting

GovWifi's FreeRADIUS configuration allows accounting requests on the default port, 1813. However, accounting is outside the scope of the GovWifi service. GovWifi's FreeRADIUS servers log, but otherwise ignore, accounting requests. 

>These logs can be found in the `frontend` in the `govwifi` AWS account.
