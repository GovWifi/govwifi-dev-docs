# Renew the Jenkins GPG key

**Note**: GovWifi no longer uses Jenkins, the naming of the GPG key is a relic of when the team maintained a Jenkins pipeline.

If you see an error stating that this key has expired, please contact the GovWifi SREs.

You may encounter this error when trying to re-encrypt the secrets in [govwifi-build](https://github.com/GovWifi/govwifi-build). This key is also used in the [sync-certs Codebuild job](https://github.com/GovWifi/govwifi-terraform/blob/master/govwifi-sync-certs/codebuild.tf).

If you are a member of the SRE team and you are looking for further documentation, please review [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16xFh1ZSAnw5o-MN5rP8BRz0701AlJ4rWXG3jY7YNWjY/edit).
