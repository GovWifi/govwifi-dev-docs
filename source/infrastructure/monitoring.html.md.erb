# Monitoring

## Grafana

Grafana is an open source analytics and monitoring platform, and we
use it for monitoring the health of GovWifi in realtime.

There are two self hosted Grafana instances for the Production and
Staging environments, and one Grafana instance hosted by the GOV.UK
PaaS team which exposes data regarding the product page and tech docs.

### Self-hosted

The self-hosted Grafana is used for monitoring GovWifi infrastructure and APIs. This
[Google Document contains in-depth information on the technical
setup][Govwifi Grafana Setup Doc] (you must be a member of the Govwifi
team to view this document).

You can access the dashboard using the links below (you must be signed into the dashboard to do this):

- [Production](https://grafana.wifi.service.gov.uk/)
- [Staging](https://grafana.staging.wifi.service.gov.uk/)

### Hosted on GOV.UK PaaS (Platform as a Service)

The [GOV.UK PaaS][GOV.UK PaaS] hosts a [GovWifi dashboard][GovWifi dashboard],
developers and RE have admin-level access. It is used for
monitoring performance of GovWifi Product Pages and Tech Docs.

## Google Analytics

We currently have a tab with default Google Analytics dashboard
open. This will be iterated over to make it more useful in the near
future.

## Prometheus

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) is an
open source software application used for event monitoring and
alerting. It records real-time metrics in a time series database built
using a HTTP pull model, with flexible queries and real-time alerting.

We run a Prometheus server which scrapes metrics from Prometheus log
exporters running on the FreeRADIUS containers.

These Prometheus exporters provide a wide range of information about
the actual FreeRADIUS server state and the packages being processed.

The information is used for diagnostics and tracking service
availability.

If you have SSH access, you can run the commands below to see the
dashboard.  If not, please speak to the reliability engineers on the
team about access.

Staging Ireland

```
ssh -L 9090:127.0.0.1:9090 prometheus-ie.staging.govwifi
```

Staging London

```
ssh -L 9090:127.0.0.1:9090 prometheus.staging.govwifi
```

Production Ireland

```
ssh -L 9090:127.0.0.1:9090 prometheus-ie.govwifi
```

Production London

```
ssh -L 9090:127.0.0.1:9090 prometheus.govwifi
```

After running the command you should be able to access the Prometheus
dashboard by entering the following address in your browser:
