# Ways of working

This section explains how the GovWifi team communicates and organises our work. It's not exhaustive or fixed, so feel free to update it.

## How we communicate

We use Slack and email.

The main Slack channels are:

- `#govwifi` - for work-related chat
- `#govwifi-core-team` - for non-work-related things

All Slack messages are deleted after 2 weeks, so put anything you might need to refer back to in an email or in a Google doc.

Please put your leave and working patterns in the team calendar.

## How we organise our work

We work in quarters and fortnightly sprints.

We have a [product roadmap](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sHVJgnOoUe-vk01h6Uzthj1669_vJfZiSCdIJgUCyNU/edit?ts=5f7c59ce#gid=1927198713) which sets out what we’re planning to work on.

We use Trello to track our progress. We have separate boards for [planning](https://trello.com/b/upKC2Xrg/govwifi-planning-ideas) and for our [sprints](https://trello.com/b/9jIWLDIa/govwifi-stand-up-q3-2020).

Our work is all saved in the team Google drive. There’s a [Google drive index](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nk8-xg9iiyp2gcFqFRkg7bNZ4v6U-EcFQigCBXlHb9g/edit) if you need help navigating it.

We have a support rota. Everyone is on support for one week every month - although this changes depending on the size of the team.

## Team charter

Our [Team charter](https://trello.com/b/4uwEWnN1/govwifi-team-charter) sets out how we’d like to work as a team. It includes things we value, and behaviours that we expect of team members.

We review and update it at the start of every quarter.
