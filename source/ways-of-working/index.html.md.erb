# Ways of working

This section explains how the GovWifi team communicates and organises our work. It's not exhaustive or fixed, so feel free to update it.

## How we communicate

We use Slack and email.

The main Slack channels are:

- `#govwifi` - for public facing GovWifi announcements, people from other teams also communicate with the GovWifi team in this channel
- `#govwifi-core-team` - for internal announcements just for GovWifi team members
- `#govwifi-monitoring` - for automated messages including pull request updates
- `#govwifi-alerting` - for automated P1 Critical alerts from AWS CloudWatch, please 'star' this channel and enable All notifications
- `#govwifi-water-cooler-chat` - for informal, non-work chat and socialising
- `#govwifi` - CO Digital Slack channel - for Daniel the Manual Spaniel document review reminders

All Slack messages are deleted after 2 weeks, so put anything you might need to refer back to in an email or in a Google doc.

Please put your leave and working pattern in the GovWifi team Google calendar.

## How we organise our work

We work in quarters with a firebreak week between each quarter and during the quarter in 2 week sprints.

Speak with the GovWifi product manager and delivery manager about product road maps. They will have the most up-to-date documentation setting out what we plan to work on.

We use Jira to track our progress. We have separate boards e.g. [backlog](https://technologyprogramme.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/GW/boards/251/backlog) and for our [current sprint](https://technologyprogramme.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/GW/boards/251).

Our non-code work is all saved in the team Google drive. There’s a [Google drive index](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nk8-xg9iiyp2gcFqFRkg7bNZ4v6U-EcFQigCBXlHb9g/edit) if you need help navigating it.

The team does not make any changes to the production servers / environment on a Friday/last day of the working week unless there is a critical issue that needs resolving.

Where possible, whole team meetings should be kept within Civil Service core hours (10-4pm). We also try to avoid scheduling meetings between the hours of 12pm-2pm, this is to allow people a one hour flexible lunch break within this time.

## Team charter

Our [Team charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12fRnnXfkafOK0jJ7AKWNXJ2v9vhmMFEqZ6X8ud7OazA/edit#heading=h.s2sawnnt2nbm) sets out how we’d like to work as a team. It includes things we value, and behaviours that we expect of team members.

We review and update it once a year.
